"I specifically lobbied for the passage of HB1104/SB878, The Maryland Voting Rights Act. The Act would have established pre clearance for all changes to voting rules, methods, and procedures for jurisdictions that would fall under its coverage. The coverage formula is based on several different racial and demographic factors. 

I also specifically lobbied for the HB1071. HB1071 passed the legislature. This new law prohibits police officers from initiating the stop of a person or the search of a vehicle based on the smell of marijuana by itself. 

I specifically lobbied against SB1. SB1 places several new gun restrictions on sensitive places and places of public space.
